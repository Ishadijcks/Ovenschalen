## Ovenschalen

> Your favorite game, ruined by math, forever.

_Ovenschalen_ is an exciting party game in which player throw dice into a baking dish (Ovenschaal).
If your roll causes a duplicate you have to take both dice out and your turn is over.
Otherwise, you can choose to roll again. Dice that come up 6 are eliminated from the game.
The last player to lose their dice loses the game!

This project implements the _Ovenschalen_ game and provides basic strategies for it.
It also provides a set of benchmarks to test custom strategies against.
